# Turing-Virtual-Machine
Written for CS_441 Computer Systems Architecture during the Spring semester of 2024 at SUNY Polytechnic Institute.

This code is a Virtual Machine that takes a binary file with instructions and a tape file with data. Per the binary file's inructions and using the encodings specified in the included encodings.h file, the data will be altered and acted upon until instructed to stop. The final result of each tape will output, along with the number of head movements and instructions read for each tape. At the end of the program, it will output the total number of head moves and instructions read along ALL tapes.
